#### DriverGroup: a novel method for identifying driver gene groups
By: Vu V.H. Pham et al.

The effect of a single gene may not be sufficient to drive cancer progression - driver gene groups work in concert to regulate the same targets/markers, and could be coding or non-coding. Thus, DriverGroup provides the means to detect such driver groups, which is useful to understand the disease and to invent new treatments. As cancer is driven by proliferation, the method identifies groups of genes which collaboratively regulate proliferation genes by finding 'critical nodes' in a constructed interaction network based on appropriate data. The driver gene group is a maximal subset of critical nodes which have the maximum impact on the proliferation genes (i.e. adding or removing one critical node will decrease the impact of the subset)

The methodology has three stages using gene expression and gene interaction data:

1. Construct gene network
The TCGA BRCA dataset contains expression data of miRNAs, TFs and mRNAs of tumour and normal samples. Tumour samples used to identify edges of gene network, and normal samples used to compute node weights. Also integrate other interactions to refine the TF-gene-mRNA network, e.g. protein-protein interactions, to remove interactions not supported by these databases.
3. Discover critical nodes
Critical nodes discovered by applying control theory and the Network Control method [[202104011508-Network_Control_Theory]].  The MDNS is mined for critical nodes (node whose absence increases the size of the MDNS - if node is critical, its removal requires bigger MDNS to fully control the network). 
5. Identify driver gene groups based on critical nodes
Inspired by Influence Maximisation problem (IM) [[202004011453-Influence_Maximisation_Problem]], they developed novel algorithms to compute the influence of a group of critical nodes on the proliferation genes. The IM problem (k-seed set) is used to find influence of groups of critical nodes on proliferation genes.

Applied to BRACA dataset to identify driver groups for breast cancer. When tested on BRCA group, driver gene sets related to literature evidence. Subtypes identified based on predicted driver groups have significant prognostic values for survival analysis, thus may have clinical implications for cancer treatment.

Could also be applied to study compound MoA - driver gene groups = activated pathways?
