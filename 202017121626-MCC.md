#### Matthew's Correlation Coefficient (MCC)
Matthew's Correlation Coefficient or MCC (also called phi-coefficient) is often used for binary classification problems. It works by computing the correlation coefficient between the true and predicted class - the higher the correlation, the better the classifier is at making predictions.

MCC ranges from -1 to 1.

Benefits of MCC are that it uses all four aspects of a confusion matrix. MCC will only be high if the classifier is performing well at classifying both positive and negative classes, and has been found to provide a more informative and truthful score for evaluating binary classifications in contrast to accuracy and F1 score (Chicco and Jurman, 2020).
