#### Predicting therapeutic drugs for hepatocellular carcinoma based on tissue-specific pathways
By: Liang Yu, Meng Wang, Yang Yang, Fengdan Xu, Xu Zhang, Fei Xie, Lin Gao and Xiangzhi Li

This approach considers the functional information of pathways, changes of a single gene in pathways, and the relationship between HCC and liver tissue. Up- and down-regulated genes in each cancer-associated pathway, counter-regulated the most by each drug instance was searched. The degree of counter-regulation of up- and down- genes was combined for each drug instance. The combined degrees of counter-regulation were then averaged over all cancer-associated pathway genes + instances of each drug, to give one therapeutic score for each drug. Drugs were then ranked by therapeutic scores.
