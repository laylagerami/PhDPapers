#### LASSO

LASSO stands for Lease Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator.

Lasso regression is a linear regression technique that uses shrinkage [[202017121643-Shrinkage]]. It produces simple and sparse models, with few parameters. They are useful for models with high levels of multicollinearity [[202017121645-Multicollinearity]], or when certain parts of model selection (variable selection/parameter elimination) need to be autmated.

Lasso regression performs L1 regularisation [[202017121647-L1_Regularisation]], which results in sparse models with few coefficients. The goal of the Lasso algorithm is to minimise the following:

The tuning parameter, $delta, controls the strength of the L1 penality and thus the amount of shrinkage.
- When $delta is 0, no parameters are eliminated (normal linear regression)
- When $delta incerases, more coefficients are set to 0 and eliminated (as it tends to infinity, all coefficients are eliminated)
- As $delta increases, bias inceases [[202017121654-Bias]]
- As $delta decreases, variance increases [[202017121656-Variance]]
