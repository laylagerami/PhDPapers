Usually used in the context of social media.
For example, suppose a company wants to select influential users of social media to provide free samples in exchange for product promotion - expecting its positive influence to spread over the entire social network. To maximise influence spread within a limited budget, one could use influence maximisation (IM).

Influence maximisation finds a k-seed set that incurs the maximum influence spread. A k-seed set indicates a set of k nodes that initiate influence propagation (i.e. those who should receieve free samples); the influence is then propagated in accordance with an information diffusion model. The amount of influence spread by a seed set corresponds to the number of non-seed nodes eventually getting activated by the seed set.
