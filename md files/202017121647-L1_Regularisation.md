#### L1 Regularisation

[[https://www.statisticshowto.com/regularization/]]

L1 regularisation adds an L1 penalty equal to the absolute value of the magnitude of coefficients. In other words, it limits the size of the coefficients. L1 can yield sparse models (i.e. models with few coefficients).

A linear regression model that implements L1 norm for regularisation is called LASSO regression [[202017121640-LASSO]].
