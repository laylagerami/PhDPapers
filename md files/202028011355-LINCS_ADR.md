#### Drug-induced adverse events prediction with the LINCS L1000 data
By: Wang, Clark and Ma'ayan

- ML classifier using chemical structure (CS) and gene expression (GE) features (LINCS)
- Integration of features improves ADR prediction
- Transforming GE data to enrichment vectors improves predictive capability

- On and off-label ADRs from SIDER and PharmGKB
- Reference gold standard from OMOP
- Strongest sigatures used - 'distil_ss' from metadata
	- Magnitude of differential expression of landmark genes compared to average drug treatment with DMSO
- Principal Angle Enrichment Analysis (PAEA) used to compute enrichment p-values for each signature

- ADR prediction was a multi-label classification task
	- Binary Relevance method
- GE, CS, cell morphology and GO vectors combined for feature selection
	- Independently for each ADR
- Top 50 features chosen from 75% random sampled drugs, and Logit model 
- Extra Trees trained for each ADR and evaluated using 3-fold CV
- To balance the class sizes, we adjusted the weights for the two classes (0 and 1) to the inverse of class frequencies in the loss functions of both feature selection and the classifier to improve the predictability of rare ADRs
