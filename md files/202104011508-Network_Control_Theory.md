According to the Network Control method, any directed network can be controlled by a subset of nodes in the network (driver nodes).

Suppose we have a directed network with N nodes. Such a network will have an adjacency matrix, A(NxN), which captures the interaction strength between nodes (0 if no edge between two nodes). The matrix B(NXM) then represents the interaction of an external controller on M nodes (where M<=N) in the network, where each point in the matrix specifies the strength of the interaction between the external controller and each network node.

The M nodes are the driver nodes of the network based on the controllability. The MDNS or Minimum Driver Node Set is thus the driver node set with the smallest number of nodes.
