#### Basic Epigenomics Notes

**ChIP-Seq**
Chromatin immunoprecipitation with sequencing identifies genome-wide DNA binding sites for TFs and other proteins.

**Peaks**
H3K27ac is an epigenetic modification to Histone H3, which indicates acetylation of the 27th lysine residue of the protein. It is associated with the higher activation of transcription and is therefore defined as an active enhancer mark.

H2K27me3 is an epigenetic modification to Histone H3, which indicates the tri-methylation at the 27th lysine residue of the protein. It is associated with the downregulation of nearby genes via the formation of heterochromatic (tighly packed DNA) regions.

**Enhancer vs. Promoter**
The **promoter region** is the **sequence** typically referred to that's right upstream or right next to where a gene is about to be transcribed. It's the **region** where certain regulatory elements will bind; these are proteins that will bind to help RNA get transcribed.

**Enhancer** is a short (50â€“1500 bp) region of DNA that can be bound by protein activators to increase the likelihood that transcription of a particular gene will occur.
