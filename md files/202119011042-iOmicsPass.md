Computational approches for multiomics data integration are usually designed for the unsupervised detection of multiomics features explaining large phenotypic variations. This may be achieved by extracting latent signals in heterogeneous data sets, or by exploiting biological networks to propagate differential expression signatures.

Few approaches directly consider molecular interaction as a data feature (the linker between different omics data sets). iOmicsPASS is a tool which searches for predictive subnetworks consisting of molecular interactions within/between related omics data types. Each interaction is given a score, and a modified nearest shrunken centroid algorithm [[202118011046-Nearest_Shrunken_Centroids]] is used to select densely connected subnetworks which are able to predict each phenotypic group.

iOmicsPASS performs two main tasks:
1. Integrate quantitative multiomics data by computing interaction scores for a given network
2. Discover a set of molecular interactions whose joint expression patterns predict phenotypic groups -> predictive subnetworks

iOmicsPASS accurately identifies key interactions underlying phenotype-predictive signals with high sensitivity under varying network coverage. The adaptive centroid calculation and group-specific shrinkage operator yield locally connected predictive subnetworks, with improved predictive performance over other feature selection methods.

iOmicsPASS was also able to recapitulate a network of hormone receptors and transcription regulators defining BRCA subtypes, and identifies additional markers and networks positively regulated in the basal-like subtypes.
