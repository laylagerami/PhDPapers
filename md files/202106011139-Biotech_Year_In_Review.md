#### The Biotech Paradox of 2020: A Year in Review
From https://lifescivc.com/2021/01/the-biotech-paradox-of-2020-a-year-in-review/

2020 was the greatest year ever for the biopharma industry, in particular for emerging biotech. 
- COVID vaccines developed and deployed by multiple companies
- Regulators helped to facilitate their reapid development, while maintaining efficacy and safety standards
- New anti-viral antibodies and medicines have also been developed
- Proved what worked, and what didn't work

As well as COVID, R&D in general continued at a productive and fast pace. This is due to adaptation to the wfh/remote working model. For example, the FDA's CDER approved 53 new medicines in 2020 (2nd place of all time with 1996 and beaten only by 2018). Some new medicines include:
- Trodelvy for triple negative breast cancer
- Danyelza for pediatric neuroblastoma
- Risdiplam for SMA
- Tepezza for thyroid eye disease
- Medicines for rare diseases such as Duchenne, progeria, rare cancers, Ebola and Chagas

As well as approved medicines, 2020 was also full of other breakthroughs. 
- CRISPR Therapeutics and Vertex's CTX001 exciting proof-of-concept in sickle cell disease and transfusion-dependent thalassemia with CRISPR gene editing
- Myokardia's mavacamten showed improved heart function in a Phase 3 study
- VelosBio's VLS-101 showed efficacy in pretreated lymphomas
- Novartis' Iptacopan showed Phase 2 activity in regulating complement in C3 glomerulopathy and paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria
- Acceleron's sotatercept showed promise in Pulmonary Arterial Hypertension
- Tyk2 contines in psoriasis
- SGLT2 continue in kidney/heart disease
- KRAS-directed programs in cancer continue

Due to all of this, biotech equity markets had their best year ever:
- Every major biotech stock index hit its All Time High in 2020
- Biotech IPOs hit their All Time High for volume and deal activity
- Post-IPO performance with regard to first day and first month stock reaction hit All Time High
- Follow-on equity financings in biotech hit All Time High
- Venture capital funding in biotech hit All Time High and blew marker away!
